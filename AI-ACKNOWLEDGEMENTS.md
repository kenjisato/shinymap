# AI Acknowledgements

Most of the code in this repository was written by AI assistants, primarily Anthropic's Claude (Sonnet 4.5) via the Claude Code CLI.

I (the human maintainer) directed the project, made architectural decisions, reviewed code, and guided implementation. But Claude wrote most of the actual Python, TypeScript, and React code, the test suites, the build configurations, and much of the documentation.

OpenAI's ChatGPT contributed to early exploration and prototyping.

This isn't meant to diminish the work—it's honest accounting. The code quality, test coverage, and documentation are real. But they exist through collaborative AI-assisted development.

If you're evaluating this project for academic or professional purposes, this context matters.
